This example demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs: arithmetic overflow and the related improper handling of flags.  The program adds a value to a field. If the result exceeds the field's defined size, an overflow occurs, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.  The solution involves using a larger data type for the variable to avoid overflow, and properly setting a flag to indicate the overflow condition. The solution also includes error handling for cases that could cause unexpected results during runtime.
